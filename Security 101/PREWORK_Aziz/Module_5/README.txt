1. Command Syntax Options:- Here are few examples of command.
	1. rm -i :- To ask for permission to delete every single file.
	2. rm -rf foldername/ :- Some time few folder won't delete because of running some file in background, this command will delete that folder by force. 
	3. rm a*-  To delete all files in a folder that start with the letter, By using * will delete file start with that letter.

2. Operating System:- 
	a. What Linux is :- Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
	b. What is a distribution :- A Linux distribution is an operating system made from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package management system.
	c. Why there are so many distributions :- Linux is an operating system core or kernel with a modular build around it, I think the point of making Linux is to customise linux for particular or more selected work purpose, and by making linux for selected work only, linux will be more productive in that particular area and that's why the reason now there are tons of distribution of linux and each distribution.
	d. What open source means :- Open source license for software that grants the source code and can be modify redistribute it but depending on the specific open source license and codes may come with certain condition like anyone can see source code, share, and can you use the source code and modify codes or marge with your source code to make exact product and then you can share the new version.

	Note :- a & b were taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux due to provide real history about linux.

3. Programming Languages :- 
	a. What is programming languages :- Languages are the medium can communicate with others and computer need number of statements to communicate and these number of statements called Program. For example 'C language' is programming language but its translator to computers, so human can communicate with translator to communicate with computer.

	b. Why are there so many programming languages :- There are so many programming languages available such as C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and more, each programming languages have their tools for certain development but over time developments change and languages become outdate or some time newer version or new programming languages release to make work easy and more creativities in to project.


	c. Are different languages useful for different technological industries? :- Yes, each language have the capabilities to support different type of technological industries, and its depends on the requirements of the project, time and most importantly cost of project, for example WEB programming companies use JavaScript, PHP, CSS, HTML but big companies want more insights in website like data science, statistics, analytics for their website and those companies use Python, R, Matlab and similar to develop games company use C/C++/C#/Objective-C/Swift and to develop Mobile Apps companies use Swift, Java (Android), JavaScript and React Native (both) and now new one Flutter & Dart. So yes each language have advantages and disadvantage for projects that's why different languages useful for different technological industries.



Part 2
1.What do you want to learn from this boot camp?
My first reason to join this boot camp to get motivation and learn what is cyber security foundation, to be honest to learn anything everyone need hands-on practice & time, and I want to gain real-world experience and I want to learn all popular tools such as Wireshark, Kali Linux, Metasploit, Nessus, and more from this bootcamp.

2. Are there any topics or domains that you are most excited about?
I am excited about Kali Linux and Metasploit, I am learning those two topics online on different platform but still these topics new for me, and I am really really excited about all those cyber security skillset that even I don't know yet, so I hope before & after every class I will learn something exciting.

3. How will the skills you'll learn in this class help your career?
Firstly I will learn about systems and networks foundation, learn the architecture of Network in this bootcamp and then I will able to see how system work in real tech world, it will set path for me to walk on it. At the moment all I have is little bit of skill from internet and lots of question to ask. And most importantly this bootcamp skillset will give me motivation, give me more knowledge and a path to walk in to achieve my career goals, I have been teaching my self coding and programming for one year and every night I got demotivated and got lost and after I finish my projects I feel where to go from here, but this bootcamp skills will help me to get more experience and I will able to plan what I can do after this bootcamp.

4. Write about how these skills will help you reach your goal?
My goals are to get OSCP certification & OSWE certification. And this bootcamp skills will help me to achieve these goals. I will learn from this bootcamp Networking, Systems, Cybersecurity, Ethical hacking and penetration, Programming and scripting and I believe all these skills will help me to achieve all my goal and get job in cyber security industry.
